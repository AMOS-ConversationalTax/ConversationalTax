# Conversational Tax 
ConTax is a students' project, which took place in the summersemester 2018. It was part of 'The AMOS project' course teached at the Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nuremberg. ConTax is an app focusing on a conversational interface. It guides the user through (parts) of his/her tax declaration.

## Technologies
The app is based on the **React Native** framework to achieve a cross-platform mobile application. Furthermore, the frontend uses **Expo** to simplify the deployment and developing process. The backend uses **NestJS**, a Node.js framework for server-side applications. It is based on ExpressJS and heavily inspired by Angular. Last but not least, both parts are written **TypeScript** for strong-typed source code.
